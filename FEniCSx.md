# notes on FEniCSx

## Installation
- Currently developed actively, and api also changes
- 
- has complex mode and real mode; PDE solver library PETSc has either real or complex build, and FEniCSx has to be switched to the corresponding mode. Below command to check the available version and build, and install PETSc(Corresponding FEniCSx will be automatically installed). It is an idea to install both in different environment to allow switching.


'''
conda search -c conda-forge PETSc
conda install -c conda-forge petsc=3.21.6=complex_h9a830cf_0
