<p>My name is Masanori.
I share my thoughts and outputs of my personal projects in this website.</p>

<p>I fear the trend that people spend more and more time on the internet world.
One reason I love studios is because it hosts real community, and I feel that internet space canâ€™t substitute the real one.
However, I decided to extend my world to this virtual world (by making this website) in hope to enrich the material world.</p>
