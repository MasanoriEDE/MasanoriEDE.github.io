    My journey started when I first got fascinated by films as a high school student. The insatiable desire to understand the art and technology behind film and music led me to acquire broad range of skill sets, from audio engineering, acoustics to computer science. Now, with this unique blend of expertise, I am working on a research project on room acoustic modeling as a MPhil student at University of Salford, while working on mixing/mastering project from time to time.

    I like to use this analogy. A great painter could excel at crafting brushes, and a skilled butcher might be a master of knife-making. Creating exceptional tools and using them well are two sides of the same coin—or, perhaps, a **mirror**. The same goes for acoustics. My goal is to be an acoustician who deeply understands the needs of audio engineers, and an audio engineer who’s fully attuned to the nuances of studio acoustics.
    
    Thanks.
