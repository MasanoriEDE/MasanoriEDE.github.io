## Interest

I am fascinated by tools that enables creaters and designers work more creatively and precisely.
I have seen how different algorithm or interface can change the way people think and work, and I want to develop tools that allow me to work better.
As an acoustician, I am interested in developing a room acoustic model that can represent complex room modes both in frequency domain and time domain.
As an audio engineer, I am interested in studio environment and audio plugins that allow more creative and precise workflow.
